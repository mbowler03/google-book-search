# google-book-search


## Overview
ReactGoogle Books Search app. This uses React components and Axios to query and display books based on user searches. 
MongoDB was also used so that users can save books to review or purchase later. While this is a simple app, I believe that the site shows a good range of skills from using a database to fetching data from a restful api.
